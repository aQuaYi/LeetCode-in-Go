# [173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/)

## 题目

        Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
