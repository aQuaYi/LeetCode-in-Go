# [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

## 题目
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

```
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]  is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
