# [483. Smallest Good Base](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-good-base/)

## 题目

        For an integer n, we call k>=2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1.
Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of n in string format. 

Example 1:
Input: "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.



Example 2:
Input: "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.



Example 3:
Input: "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.



Note:

The range of n is [3, 10^18].
The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.
