# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

## 题目
A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

```
For example,
Given encoded message "12",
it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.
```
