# [977. Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 10000
- -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
- A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
