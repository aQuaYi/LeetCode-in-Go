# [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## 题目

        We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: 

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!


Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
