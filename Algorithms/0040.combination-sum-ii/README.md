# [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)

## 题目
Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
For example, given candidate set [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5] and target 8, 
A solution set is:
``` 
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
```
