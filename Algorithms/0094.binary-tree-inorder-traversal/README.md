# [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

## 题目
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.


```
For example:
Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].
```

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
