# [230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## 题目

        Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.

Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
