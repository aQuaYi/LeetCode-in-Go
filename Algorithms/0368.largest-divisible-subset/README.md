# [368. Largest Divisible Subset](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/)

## 题目

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

Example 1:

```text
nums: [1,2,3]

Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
```

Example 2:

```text
nums: [1,2,4,8]

Result: [1,2,4,8]
```
