# [86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

## 题目
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
return 1->2->2->4->3->5.
```
