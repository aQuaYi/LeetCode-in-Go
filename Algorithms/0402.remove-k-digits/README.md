# [402. Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/)

## 题目

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:

- The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.
- The given num does not contain any leading zero.

Example 1:

```text
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```
