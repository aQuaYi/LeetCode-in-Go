# [341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/)

## 题目

        Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:
Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]],

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].



Example 2:
Given the list [1,[4,[6]]],

By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
