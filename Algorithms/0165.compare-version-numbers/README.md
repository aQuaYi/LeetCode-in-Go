# [165. Compare Version Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/)

## 题目
Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1, if version1 < version2 return -1, otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.
The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
```
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 13.37
```
