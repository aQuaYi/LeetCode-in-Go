# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

## 题目

        Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number


12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
